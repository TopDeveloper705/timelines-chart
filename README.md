# Stacked Timelines Chart

A stacked timelines layout for representing state of time-series over time. 
Each timeline segment can be assigned a value on a color scale (either continuous of ordinal for categorical representation).
Time-series can be grouped into logical groups, represented as distinct sections. Allows for exploration using drag-to-zoom or a timeline brush.
Current example (index.html in local folder) populated with randomly generated data.
